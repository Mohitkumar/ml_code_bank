time series- ARCH, GARCH, ARIMA (moving average, derivatives, remove outliers)
Image - conv net(scale, resize, annotating, smmothning)
Text data- Linear models, Vowpal wabbit, Factorization machines(libFm), SVD(tfidf, countvectorizers, word2vec
svd(dim reduction), stemming, onehot encoding, hashing)
Normal data- Xgboost, tensorflow, keras(deep-learn) (univariate feature transformation(log_+1), feature selection
convert categories, remove outliers)


Data transformation -  scaling, removing outliers, null values, transform categorical features, create features interaction

start from null model- keep on adding features/ start from full model remove features

feature importance- random forest, xgb


Cross validation techinques-
Kfold, stratified kfold, random split,

Missing values-
mean, mode, median imputation
use out of range values -9999
